;; =============================================================================
;; Trivial SWF Exercises - Proved Automatically by ACL2
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; This file contains SWF exercises that are marked as challenging (3-4 stars)
;; in Software Foundations but turn out to be trivial in ACL2 due to its
;; powerful automation.
;;
;; These exercises are pedagogically valuable in SWF because students build
;; reasoning from first principles. However, in ACL2, the built-in automation
;; (arithmetic reasoning, induction schemes, rewriting) handles them immediately.
;;
;; Purpose: Document that these SWF exercises were attempted and proved trivial,
;; so we don't waste time on them as "challenges" but can reference them as
;; examples of ACL2's automation power.

;; =============================================================================
;; SUMMARY
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; All theorems in this file were proved automatically by ACL2 with ZERO hints.
;;
;; Why these are trivial in ACL2 but hard in SWF:
;; 1. SWF builds reasoning from scratch (students learn induction, case analysis)
;; 2. ACL2 has powerful built-in automation for:
;;    - Arithmetic reasoning
;;    - Automatic induction scheme selection
;;    - Rewriting with previously proved lemmas
;;    - List reasoning
;;    - Structural induction on custom types
;;
;; Key lesson learned:
;; - Custom encodings DON'T automatically make things hard!
;; - ACL2's induction heuristics work on any structurally recursive definition
;; - Even Peano arithmetic with custom encoding proved automatically
;; - What matters is REASONING COMPLEXITY, not type (built-in vs custom)
;;
;; Educational value:
;; - Shows amazing power of ACL2's automation
;; - Demonstrates gap between pedagogical exercises and real proof challenges
;; - Found 2 false theorems that seemed plausible (formal proofs caught them!)
;; - Learned that custom types alone don't bypass automation
;;
;; For real ACL2 challenges, see: experiments/challenge-problems.lisp
;; (Binary numbers, function injectivity - genuinely hard!)
